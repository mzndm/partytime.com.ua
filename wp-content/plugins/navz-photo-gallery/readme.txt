`<?php
	//Get the images ids from the post_metadata
	$images = acf_photo_gallery('gallery_images', $post->ID);
	//Check if return array has anything in it
	if( count($images) ):
		//Cool, we got some data so now let's loop over it
		foreach($images as $image):
			$title = $image['title'];
			$caption= $image['content'];
			$full_image_url= $image['full_image_url'];
			$full_image_url = acf_photo_gallery_resize_image($full_image_url, 262, 160);
			$thumbnail_image_url= $image['thumbnail_image_url'];
			$url= $image['url'];
			$target= $image['target'];
?>
<div class="col-xs-6 col-md-3">
	<div class="thumbnail">
		<?php if( !empty($url) ){ ?><a href="<?php echo $url; ?>" <?php echo ($target == 'true' )? 'target="_blank"': ''; ?>><?php } ?>
			<img src="<?php echo $full_image_url; ?>" alt="<?php echo $title; ?>" title="<?php echo $title; ?>">
